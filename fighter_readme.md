## üìä Game Mechanics

### Damage Calculation

```rust
// Base damage range scales with level
min_damage = base_attack + (level * 2)
max_damage = base_attack + (level * 5)

// Random value within range
strike_damage = random(min_damage, max_damage)

// Critical hit check (% based)
if random(0, 100) < critical_chance {
    strike_damage *= critical_multiplier  // Default 1.5x
}

// Combo bonus
if (damage_range == last_damage_range) {
    combo_count++
    if combo_count == 2: damage *= 1.5
    if combo_count >= 3: damage *= 2.0
}

// Apply defender's defense
final_damage = strike_damage * (1 - defense / 100)
```

### XP & Leveling

```rust
// XP required for next level
xp_required = 100 * (current_level ^ 2)

// XP rewards
win_xp = 100 * (staked_battle ? 1.5 : 1.0)
loss_xp = 20 * (staked_battle ? 1.5 : 1.0)

// Level up bonuses
+10 HP
+3 Attack
+1 Defense
+2% Crit Chance (every 5 levels, max 30%)
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_fighter_registration

# Run with logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test test_free_battle_complete_flow -- --nocapture

# Integration tests
cargo test --test fighter_game
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Implemented Safeguards

1. **Authentication**: All operations require authenticated owner
2. **Validation**: Input validation on all parameters (names, amounts, etc.)
3. **Tier Restrictions**: Prevents unfair matchmaking
4. **Timeout Protection**: Prevents indefinite battle locks
5. **Double-spend Prevention**: Stake amounts validated before battle creation
6. **Claim Guards**: Predictions can only be claimed once
7. **Battle State Checks**: Operations validated against current battle status

### Randomness

Current implementation uses pseudo-random generation for simplicity:
```rust
seed = battle_id ^ timestamp ^ chain_id_hash
```

**Production Recommendation**: Integrate proper VRF (Verifiable Random Function):
- Linera's built-in randomness oracle (when available)
- External oracle service (Chainlink VRF equivalent)
- Commit-reveal schemes for critical randomness

### Economic Security

- **Platform Fee**: 10% on staked battles and predictions prevents exploitation
- **Stake Escrow**: Funds locked until battle completion
- **Prediction Locking**: Pools lock when battle starts
- **Gas Costs**: Multiple strikes per battle - optimized for Linera's low fees

## üí° Design Rationale

### Why Linera?

1. **Low Gas Costs**: Multiple strikes per battle require minimal fees
2. **Fast Finality**: Real-time gameplay without long confirmation times
3. **Microchains**: Isolated battle state for efficient computation
4. **Native Randomness**: Built-in support for fair RNG (when available)
5. **Developer Experience**: Rust-based with excellent tooling

### Architecture Decisions

**Monolithic State vs Microchains**
- Main chain: Fighter registry, tournaments, leaderboards
- Battle-specific chains: Could be implemented for isolated combat
- Current: Single-chain for simplicity, expandable to microchains

**On-Chain vs Off-Chain**
- Combat logic: Fully on-chain for trustlessness
- NFT metadata: On-chain for composability
- Analytics: Can be indexed off-chain for performance
- Randomness: Should move to oracle in production

**Gas Optimization**
- Batch strike operations where possible
- Lazy leaderboard updates (only on query)
- Minimal storage in battle logs
- Efficient data structures (Vec, HashMap)
